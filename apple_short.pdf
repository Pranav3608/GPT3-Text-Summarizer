Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's

Tejas Gala
Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking today first is

I'd like to now turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.
Tim Cook
Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's 
biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue 
record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had 
expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active
installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion 
devices.
We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue 
growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would 
be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply 
constraints that were higher than the September quarter.
Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the 
toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, 
case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point 
throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep
gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses and so many others on the front lines 
of combating COVID-19.
This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And 
while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our
teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers.
A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to
the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally 
transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and 
meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made 
the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop 
creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout 
our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our 
powerful yet easy to use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems 
to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the
industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect 
Apple to solve hard problems with easy to use products. And iPhone has never been 
more popular.
During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks 
to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup 
we've ever had and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the 
charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac with
customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac or MacBook 
Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max 
chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance
and efficiency.
Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be 
indispensable to tens of millions of people, from teachers and students to artists 
and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, 
which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the 
new iPad Mini with its ultra portable design.
Wearable, Home and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. 
Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7, with its cutting edge health and 
fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share 
how a heart alert led to a life saving appointment with a cardiologist. And more 
recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved 
their lives by calling 911, when they couldn't.
As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work that every day 
I'm encouraged by our positive impact.
We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from 
customers as a result. The HomePod Mini continues to earn praise for combining the 
intelligence of Siri with an immersive room filling audio experience. And our 
customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on 
AirPods which packs the acoustics of a concert hall.
As always, the deep integration of hardware, software and services is a hallmark of
everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of
SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by 
letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime.
And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set 
another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had 
anticipated.
The App Store continues to be an economic miracle for developers around the world 
and a safe and trusted place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since 
its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than 
$260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings.
I'm also happy to report that in its first 2 years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have
earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations. Among the powerful lineup are 
feature films like The Tragedy of Macbeth, CODA and Swan Song, along with many 
gripping new series coming up, including Severance and The Afterparty. Each one is 
a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them
who touched audiences all over the world.
Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and 
fitness goals. We recently introduced Time to Run, an extension of our popular 
series Time to Walk, as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help
users make more intentional training choices.
Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple's 
history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is 
a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined
[digital] experience.
I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for 
the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our
products, learn new skills or track down the perfect gift.
We have always led with our values and with compassion and care and never has that 
been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of 
our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and 
support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match their 
contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local
food pantry to global humanitarian non-profits. In the last decade, this program 
has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations.
We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on Project 
RED supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in Sub-Saharan 
Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've 
now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing and counseling services 
for people impacted by HIV/AIDS.
And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also 
launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of America. This initiative 
will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can
Code curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate 
change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working
intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and 
the life cycle of our products.
To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple 
Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch Face. And 
through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support 
organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our 
classrooms and our criminal justice system.
We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound 
challenges. And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own 
work and inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day.
Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one 
thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to [innovate] every day and in 
every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best.
I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.
